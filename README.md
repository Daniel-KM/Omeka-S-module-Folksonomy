Tagging (module for Omeka S)
============================

[Tagging] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows to add uncontrolled topics to
any resource and that allows visitors to tag them in order to create a
folksonomy or a tag cloud.

Tags can be added with or without captcha and approbation. Once approved, users
tags become normal tags. Tag creation and approbation can be managed via roles.

This [Omeka S] module is a full rewrite of the [Tagging plugin] for [Omeka Classic].


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename module folder "Tagging".

Then install it like any other Omeka module and follow the config instructions.

The Tagging plugin can use Omeka ReCaptchas. You need to get keys to this
service and set them in the general preferences.


Displaying Tagging Form
-----------------------

The plugin will add tagging form automatically on `item/show` page if the
current user has right to use it.

It can be added too via code in the theme (`tagging/tag.phtml`).

```php
    <a href="#" id="display-tagging-form" class="button blue right" onclick="return false;">+</a>
    <?php echo $this->getTaggingForm($item); ?>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        jQuery("a#display-tagging-form").click(function(event){
            jQuery("#tagging-form").fadeToggle();
            event.stopImmediatePropagation();
        });
    </script>
```

The tagging form is customizable in the theme (common/tagging.php).

Rights are automatically managed.


Warning

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
